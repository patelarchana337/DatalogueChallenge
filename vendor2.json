Our beds are an enormous XL king-size, topped with the world's best pillows and duvets. Our showers are so powerful, they are ready to accept any jetlag challenge. And our TVs are packed with distractions (including streaming capabilities). In other words, every journey ends well in a room\ufffdat our\ufffdSeattle hotel. Your couches, your artworks. Your TV to channel surf. And your books to read too. How else could we call ourselves your home away from home? Time zones come and go, but your hunger has its own schedule. It's a good thing canteenM is open 24/7, just like your fridge at home. Good, fresh, local food, unusual snacks, killer cocktails... you want it, we serve it. Start your day well, no matter what time it starts. Ideas flow easily in a space designed for work, but also to inspire. societyM has the perfect balance of both. In fact, calling societyM 'meeting rooms' isn't quite doing them justice. They are creative spaces (with unlimited free coffee, tea, water and superfast Wi-Fi) where one person can work on a life-changing idea, or argue with up to 15 other people. It doesn't matter if you are starting a new company, knitting a sweater, or interviewing a budding rock star. Anything can happen at societyM.", "address": {"street": null, "city": " Seattle", "state": null, "zipcode": "98109"}, "rating": 2}
